# PredictorIQ Demo

This repository contains the public demo dashboard and docs for **PredictorIQ**, a prediction market intelligence and agent infrastructure project.

What you can see here:

- A Next.js dashboard UI (`client/`)
- High-level product and architecture docs (`docs/`)
- A simple guide on how to run the demo locally

The full backend (data ingestion, agents, connectors, analytics, jobs) lives in a separate private repository and is not included here. This repo is meant to show product direction and give reviewers something concrete to run and read.

For how to run the demo, see: `docs/DEMO_GUIDE.md`.
