# PredictorIQ - Demo Guide

**Audience**: External reviewers, potential investors, and collaborators
**Purpose**: Showcase the frontend UI and core features

---

## Overview

This demo showcases PredictorIQ's frontend interface and key features. The demo runs with:
- ✅ Full frontend UI (Next.js)
- ✅ Complete page structure and navigation
- ✅ UI components and design system
- ⚠️ **API calls will fail** (backend not included in public repo)
- ℹ️ Full backend available upon request (private repository)

**Important**: This is a **frontend-only POC**. The UI is fully functional, but API calls to `http://localhost:8000` will fail because the backend server is not included. This is expected behavior. You can still:
- Navigate all pages
- See the UI design and layout
- Understand the product structure
- Review the code architecture

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: 18.0 or higher
- **npm**: Latest version
- **Web Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, or Safari

---

## Quick Verification

To quickly verify the demo works:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. You should see:
- ✅ Homepage with "The Morningstar for Prediction Markets" tagline
- ✅ "View Top10" and "Join Waitlist" buttons
- ✅ Click "View Top10" to see the recommendations page (may show error/loading state due to missing backend)

**Expected Behavior**: 
- Pages will load and display correctly
- API calls will fail (showing error/loading states)
- This is **normal** - the backend is not included in this public demo

If you see the UI pages loading, the demo is working correctly!

---

## FAQ

### Q: Why do I see errors when loading pages?

**A**: This is expected! The demo is frontend-only. API calls to the backend (which is not included) will fail. The UI is designed to handle this gracefully with loading/error states. This allows you to see the complete UI design without needing the backend server.

### Q: Is the data real?

**A**: No data is displayed in this demo because the backend is not included. In the full version, the backend fetches real data from Kalshi and Polymarket APIs every 5-15 minutes.

### Q: How often is data updated?

**A**: Every 5-15 minutes in the full version, based on market liquidity.

### Q: Can I use this for actual trading?

**A**: The public demo is for evaluation only. For trading-ready version, contact the team.

### Q: What platforms do you support?

**A**: Currently Kalshi and Polymarket (~3,600 markets). Limitless, Metaculus, and PredictIt are on the roadmap.

### Q: How does personalization work?

**A**: We match your professional background, domain expertise, and location to markets where you have informational advantage. See [ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md](./ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md) for details.

### Q: Is this open source?

**A**: The frontend is available for review under MIT license. The backend is proprietary.
