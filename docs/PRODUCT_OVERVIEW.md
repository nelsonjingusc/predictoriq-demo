# PredictorIQ

> AI-Powered Prediction Market Intelligence Layer

**Status**: Public Demo / POC
**Version**: 1.0

---

## Overview

PredictorIQ is an intelligent layer on top of prediction markets that helps traders discover opportunities where they have unique informational edge.

### Core Philosophy

> **"Don't trade what's popular. Trade what you know."**

Traditional prediction market platforms show you the most traded markets. PredictorIQ shows you markets where **you** are most likely to have an advantage based on your expertise, background, and interests.
